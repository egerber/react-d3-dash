add color Themes as global setting for charts

Add testing with Jasmin for Monitor functionality

Add watch functionality to monitor/data_logger

bind different chart types to different data selectors

Add a panel of options for each type of Chart (e.g. histogram: number of bins),
-> every Charttype returns a list of options that it takes + type of these options
-> Chart Selector automatically creates a form with these elements
-> Change to these options triggers a re-render of the graph
